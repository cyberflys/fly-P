# fly-P

<br>fly-P is first project by my startup named: "cyfly".</br>
<br>P in the name stands for Plug.</br>
<br>That is because fleon P is smart plug system, designed to work via WiFi.:</br>
<br>It uses SSH protocol via JSch to connect to designated server address and activate/deactivate relay.</br>

<br>Client side: Android app made in Java</br>
<br>Server side: C++ programs used for faster execution of activating/deactivating relays.</br>

<br> PLAN FOR FUTURE IS TO : SELL fleon P PLUGS ALL OVER SERBIA! </br>

-Raspberry Pi 3
-RPi build relay
+Smart relay connections
+RPi rules
+Android client side app.
