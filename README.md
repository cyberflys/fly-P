# fleon P

<br>fleon P is first project by my startup named: "fleon".</br>
<br>P in the name stands for Plug.:</br>
<br>That is because fleon P is smart plug system, designed to work via WiFi.:</br>
<br>It uses SSH protocol via JSch to connect to designated server address and activate/deactivate relay.</br>
